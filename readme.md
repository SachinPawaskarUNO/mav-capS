## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. Laravel focuses on a more creative experience and attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing)
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container)
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent)
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations)
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues)
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting)

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb combination of simplicity, elegance, and innovation give you tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.
